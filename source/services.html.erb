            Whilst the ecosystem of social networks continues to change and grow, with an increasing number of us spending our time communicating online, their effectiveness as an advertising platform cannot be denied.

          <h2><font color="#fb8b24">PAID</font> SEARCH</h2>
          <p>
            As one of the main forms of pull-marketing, the role of search is to ensure your advertising presence when users are looking for specific products and services.<br><br>
          </p>
          <div class="show-more-btn" id='paid-search-btn'><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> Show more</div>

            <p>
              Whilst Google remains the mainstay of search engines, searches are increasingly being conducted through the likes of Amazon and virtual assistants such as Google Home.
              <br><br>
              At Arrow, we’ve built specific solutions and scripts that mean we can automate many of the optimisation tasks typically done by humans; allowing for not only a more sophisticated and performance-centric approach, but also meaning that we can focus our attention on the more macro challenges and opportunities that impact your business’s bottom line.
              <br><br>
              The key to deploying any search campaign is ensuring there is a strong foundation from which both your activity and your business can develop and grow overtime. To this end, we provide a range of services:
              <br><br>
              -   On-going strategic guidance and direction<br>
              -   Keyword and ad copy research, generation, optimisation and expansion<br>
              -   Budget setting, optimisation and management<br>
              -   Search engine competitor analysis and insight<br>
              -   Going past Google: Bing, Amazon, Baidu and beyond
